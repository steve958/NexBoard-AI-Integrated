✅ BOARD CARD BUTTON OVERFLOW - FIXED!

PROBLEM:
- 6 buttons in single row overflowed card
- Text cut off, poor layout
- Broke on smaller screens

SOLUTION:
1. Made "Open Board" button full-width (primary action)
2. Put other buttons in flex-wrap container (wraps gracefully)
3. Shortened button text ("Add member" → "Add")
4. Added min-width to prevent buttons too narrow

RESULT:
✨ Buttons never overflow
✨ Works on mobile, tablet, desktop
✨ Clear visual hierarchy
✨ Professional, modern look

FILE CHANGED:
src/app/boards/page.tsx (lines 67-136)

TEST IT:
npm run dev → Go to /boards → Resize window
